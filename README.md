# CRUD-PROJECT
An online ecommerce website where users can register and login to buy differnet amazing captured moments of different animals.
For now I only have Penguines and Dogs but in the future Planning to expand this in to a zoo like website with differnet wild and domestic animas pictures.
For this Particular project i used Spring Boot, Thymeleaf,Spring Security and roles,Spring Data Jpa,custom database.

The most difficulties I face while working on this project was on how to upload the images in the data base which was a little bit tricky. After a lot of hours researching I found the answer in both udemy and slack overflow.
