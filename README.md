# CRUD-PROJECT
An online ecommerce website where users can register and login to buy amazing captured moments of different animals.
For now we have Penguines and Dogs but in the future we are planning to expand this into a full gallery, zoo like website with an assortment of wild and domesticated animals.
For this Particular project I used Spring Boot, Thymeleaf,Spring Security,Spring Data Jpa,MYSQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS etc.

The impediments I faced while working on this project were uploading images into the database which was an intricate task. After hours of researching and development I was able to inquire and retrieve some much needed solutions, using resources such as udemy and stack overflow.
