# CRUD-PROJECT
An online ecommerce website where users can register and login to buy differnet amazing captured moments of different animals.
For now I only have Penguines and Dogs but in the future Planning to expand this in to a zoo like website with differnet wild and domestic animal pictures.
For this Particular project I used Spring Boot, Thymeleaf,Spring Security and roles,Spring Data Jpa,custom database, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and so on.

The most difficulties I face while working on this project was on how to upload the images in the data base which was a little bit tricky. After hours of researching I found the solution in both udemy and stack overflow.
